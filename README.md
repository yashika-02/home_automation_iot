IoT Home Automation Project using ESP8266, 2-Channel Relay, and Blynk App
    
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective home automation system using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, a 2-channel relay, and the Blynk mobile application. The primary goal is to remotely control two electrical appliances, represented by two light bulbs, using a smartphone or tablet.

Components:

    1. ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module: The core of the project, this microcontroller allows wireless communication with the Blynk app over the internet.
    
    2. 2-Channel Relay Module: This module acts as a switch to control the two light bulbs, each connected to a separate relay channel.
	
    3. Blynk App: A mobile application that serves as the user interface, enabling you to control the two bulbs from anywhere with internet access.
	
    4. Light Bulbs: Two standard light bulbs serve as the output devices, representing typical home appliances.

Functionality:

    1. Remote Control: Through the Blynk app, you can turn each of the two bulbs on or off individually. The app communicates with the ESP8266, which then triggers the corresponding relay to control the power to the bulbs.
    
    2. Real-Time Status Updates: The Blynk app provides real-time feedback, showing the current state (on/off) of each bulb.
    
    3. Wi-Fi Connectivity: The ESP8266 connects to your home Wi-Fi network, allowing you to control the bulbs from anywhere with internet access, whether you are at home or away.
